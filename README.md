# Montoya Clone

This is a clone of the Montoya landing page, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React.js](https://react.dev/reference/react), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). The project showcases a modern, responsive design with smooth animations and a clean user interface.

## Technologies Used

### Next.js

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It enhances performance and SEO, making it ideal for building production-level applications. In this project, I utilized Next.js for routing, API routes, and server-side rendering to ensure fast load times and improved user experience.

### React.js

React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable components, which promotes maintainability and scalability. In this project, I structured the application using functional components and hooks, ensuring a clean and efficient codebase.

### Framer Motion

Framer Motion is a popular library for animations in React applications. It provides a simple API for creating complex animations and transitions. I used Framer Motion to enhance the user experience by adding smooth animations to various elements, making the interface more engaging.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. It promotes a consistent design system and reduces the need for custom CSS. In this project, I used Tailwind CSS to style components, ensuring responsiveness and a modern aesthetic.

## Best Practices

1. **Component Segregation**: The project is structured with a clear separation of client components, server components, and assets. This modular approach enhances maintainability and allows for easier updates in the future.

2. **Performance Optimization**: Next.js features such as image optimization and code splitting were leveraged to improve performance. This ensures that users experience fast load times, which is crucial for retaining visitors.

3. **Accessibility**: I followed best practices for accessibility, ensuring that all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen reader friendly. This enhances the usability of the application for all users.

4. **Code Quality**: The codebase adheres to best practices in terms of readability and organization. I used TypeScript for type safety, which helps catch errors during development and improves the overall quality of the code.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to create a modern web application using industry-standard technologies and best practices. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Simply Jet and bring my skills to your team.
